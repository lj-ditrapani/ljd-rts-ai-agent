Help to new AI devs

[Enter] to chat
/tooltip shows tooltip in bottom corner

List chat commands: [Enter] / [tab]
/commandhelp <commandName>   # shows command description

Resolution and fullscreen setting are in .springrc (check this folder for an example)
Time delay, mod, and AIs are in the script.txt (check this folder for the one in use)
    default is in ~/.spring/script.txt, mine is in ${ljd}/

Use ./spring $ljd/script.txt to test agent--much faster
Use options in script.txt to pass info/varibles into agent

~/.spring/LuaUI/Config/BA.lua   # has BA UI settings, delete to reset


Replay:
spring replayName.sdf
spring ~/.spring/demos/replayName.sdf

~/.spring/uikeys.txt   # gives default keybindings; can unbind and bind at will

Screenshots:  f12 to take
found in ~/.spring/demos/screenshots
ctr-F1 fps mode
arrow keys to move around
F5 disables GUI

Upgrading/installing
=========================================================================
# Backup orginal source
cd $ljd
./backup
For either, must update .zshrc (verSpring=88 -> verSpring=Dev)
    - change in ~ and then copy to $configFiles
If you change the spring engine source path (example: upgrade to 88.0):
    - Must change $source variable in Makefile
If you change the spring binary install dir, must change 
    - Must change $binDir=/home/ljd/spring[Ver] in Makefile
    - update build.sh and headless.sh binPath=85 -> binPath=88

for new computer:
# Copy backup source into new binary dir
# attach hardrive
cd ~/.spring/AI/Skirmish/ljd
cp -r $ljdback .

Q's
--------------------------------------------
Use reload?
Will spring-headless save time in testing?
(spring-headless must be compiled via cmake)
Scripted game-speed speed-up?  Above x3.0?
Remove reckage/features from game? (no blocked paths :))
Get cursor position back?
Use pwd in Makefile to auto-get the current working dir (no?)
Put config and python files in ~/.spring/AI/ljd since .spring is the cwd
    -> python in config dir?
            -> config dir is easy (in cwd; under ~/.spring)
            -> no need to put 2x option in every script.txt

SGiveMeNewUnitCheatCommand
comment // returns its unit ID in ret_newUnitId
Solved // shouldn't int ret_newUnitId be int *ret_newUnitId
No!, ret_newUnitId is inside the struct!, struct is written field is 
written over!

float   UnitDef_getMaxSlope(int skirmishAIId, int unitDefId);
returns 0.0 for buildings?

# GiveGroupOrder not implemented!!!!  >:(
int CAICallback::GiveGroupOrder(int groupId, Command* c)
{
        return 0;
}

COMMAND_UNIT_WAIT_TIME doesn't work at all :(

BA
// crash on air units and buildings
int xSize = clbs[sid]->UnitDef_MoveData_getXSize(sid, defId);
int zSize = clbs[sid]->UnitDef_MoveData_getZSize(sid, defId);

Can't attack mobile enemy units outside of LOS?
